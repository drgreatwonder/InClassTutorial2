This is my note on data collection and scraping basics with datasciencecourse.org (Carnegie Melon University).
The basic concept of data collection and web scraping is explained in my note with code examples to go with it.
I also used some extra sources like the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp)
