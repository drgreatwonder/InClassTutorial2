This is my note on data collection and scraping basics with datasciencecourse.org (Carnegie Melon University).
The basic concept of data collection and web scraping is explained in my note with code examples to go with it.
I also used some extra sources like the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp).

The Data_collection_notes_with_examples.ipynb is not as long as it seems. It's the result from the scrapings that made it that long.
I left the results there for the purpose of understanding it by others who may have need for it. The "future me" is not left out, lolzzz.
